Pac-Man Factory Exercise
MIT xPRO 

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course.

Description
A project to create animated PacMen. The project uses a button to create a PacMan. Each time this is pressed a new PacMan is created at a different place on the screen. Once you are satisfied with the amount of PacMen, the 'Start Game' button can be clicked. This will start the PacMen packing in all directions at different velocities. The PacMen will also change directions when reaching the borders of the screen. 


How to Run
Download the files that are in the Pac-Men Factory Exercise directory. Open a new tab in your browser window. Drag and drop the index.html file onto the new tab. The game will appear in your browser. Click on the "Add PacMan" button and "Start Game" Button to begin.

Future improvements
Include button to add ghost
Add programing to avoid collision between Pac-Men
